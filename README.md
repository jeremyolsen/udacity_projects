## Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree

### Term 1 Projects 
* **Search Map Project (Mars Rover Simulation)**
  
  This was the very first project of the ND which served as an introduction to the course.  After reviewing the lesson materials, the     goals of this project were to write code to autonomously map a simulated environment and search for samples of interest. 
  
  The first step was to get a Unity simulator up and running. Once the simulator was running, we were to record data in training mode test functionality of the project code in the Jupyter notebook.  Were were to add custom code to search for obstacles using techniques with OpenCV.  We were then create a series of decision making commands to help navigate the rover around the map and pick up 6 randomly placed gold colored rocks located througout the map as an optional goal.

* **Robotic Arm: Pick N Place**

  The course material focused upon teaching forward and inverse kinematics.  The project expanded upon this knowlege by providing us a Gazebo simulated environment to peferform inverse kinematics when provided a list of end-effector poses and calculate joint angles for the Kuka KR210.
