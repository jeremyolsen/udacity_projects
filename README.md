Term 1 Projects
* Search Map Project (Mars Rover Simulation)
  
  This was the very first project of the ND which served as an introduction to the course.  After reviewing the lesson materials, the       goals of this project were to write code to autonomously map a simulated environment and search for samples of interest. 
  
  The first step was to get a Unity simulator up and running. Once the simulator was running, we were to record data in training mode test   functionality of the project code in the Jupyter notebook.  Were were to add custom code to search for obstacles using techniques with     OpenCV.  We were then create a series of decision making commands to help navigate the rover around the map and pick up gold colored       rocks.
