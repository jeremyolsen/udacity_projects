    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For my architecture, I opted to not change my CNN/Encoder architecture from what was provided.  My approach was to get the model up and running and reasonably training before I started trying to make changes to any of the provided code.  The RNN/Decoder is fairly simple and does not deviate very far from what I was reading on what my peers used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I opted to start with a simple sinlgle layer LSTM followed by a fully-connected linear layer.  That proved to not be a good choice as my training results were less then optimal.  After further experimentation, I opted to increase the number of layers and played with 2 and 3 layers with better results.  I also included a dropout layer via the LSTM which incresed performance by reasonable factor.  The biggest differece in reducing the loss occurred when the 'batch_first' param of the LSTM was set to to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of 'size' hyperparameters choosen were centered around the suggestion in the Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf), where they used 512 dimensions for the embeddings and size of the LSTM memory.  This led me to set the size of 512 for the 'hidden_size' and then half of that for the 'embedded_size'.  Based upon my testing, and from the information found in the video #7 in Lesson 5, the training worked best if the 'embedded_size' was smaller then the 'hidden_size'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'vocab_threshold' was set to be as small as possible based upon the description of the param in the notes above.  2 was chosen as the smalled reasonable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'batch_size' param was purely choosen for speed and performance purposes.  The larger the size, the slower each step would take to train.  Of course this reduced the number of steps, the higher this number was, however I seemed to notice that anything above the value of 64 would have negative performance effects, but that might have been a faultly observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the number of epochs was left alone at 3. This didn't seem to matter b/c  I frequely stopped and restarted the training with subtle changes and reloaded the saved weights from the pickle file, which would pick up from the last saved epoch.  I found that if I let the training run at least one epoch, my results seemed be better.  I also thought I was experiencing overtraining after two and would not proceed much beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I left these values alone as this did not seem to have any impact upon my training.  The 224x224 image size is what was required for the input into the network, thus why it was the correct choice.  As for image normalization, I'm reading that normally the values used are 0.5, 0.5, 0.5.  In this case, since there was no explaination on why these values were set, the mean-std values may be specific to the images provided and thus why I didn't make any changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I stuck with the suggested list of params that were listed above.  Based upon my limited testing and reasonable results, these are a good first choice and probably the most obvious ones to choose initially as they are the outputs of the CNN and RNN respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "I choose the Adam optimizer per final training results.  This was the first choice based upon the results I was seeing with the model we trained in Project 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried using the SGD optimizer, but found that my loss results were less then favorable.  I did not train with SGD using different learning rates, which may or may not have resulted in better results.  I did change the learning rate with Adam and found that it provided better results when I made subtle changes."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
